   </div>
    <div id="bio1" class="bio"><p>I was born Michael (pronounced me-ka-el btw) in the Capital of Ethiopia:Addis Ababa
       Being the last child and the only guy, I was 'spoiled' and got whatever I wanted.But,that didn't
       mean I abused my privilages ... a lot. I've always been fasinated at how computers work, so I got my first
       laptop when i was like 5. Although I'm from a third world country,My parents made more or less a good income
       and were able to provide me with what I needed. 
    </p>

    <p>So when I turned 12 I decided to learn my first programming language which was C++ (although I didn't go far with it for reasons I'll tell you later).
        But growing in Ethiopia and It's slow Internet connections,I had a hard time getting access to learning materials
        about any programming languages. The only fast internet we had were at the Internet cafes. so I had to go to an 
        Internet cafe and download videos off youtube,take them home and practice on my own computer, Which was
        was really tiring and inconvenient(specially when getting into complicated stuff),so I kind of stopped doing it, for now atleast.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fast forward a couple years,around my 18th birthday, I got an opportunity to come to the US. Which beleive it or not is a big deal
        when you're from a third world country. So I moved out here,but really didn't know what to do. i had two options which were,either go 
        to college or start working til I found what I really wanted to do with my life. I chose the second option and applied to a local starbucks,
        and while they were reviewing my application , I started this class online on a website called FreeCodeCamp. It's basically an online 
        "School" that helps you become a full-stack developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using FreeCodeCamp I was able to get the basic concepts of Html,css and Javascript. But the problem with the course was It didn't
        go deep enough on objects and classes, which according to my knowledge now ,are absolutely useful tools that you're gonna use on your 
        day to day programming activities. It preferenced more of advanced algorithms than objects and classes, which beleive me helped me on the Launchcode 
        program. But after I started working at starbucks, I really don't know what happened , I stopped the course (I had gotten the front-end certefication though).

        About a year and a half later,I was talking to my friend (who is also taking this course as well) about how I've always liked programming and how I've somewhat 
        a basic understanding of HTML,CSS and Javascript,He told me about you guys. So I decided to apply to Launchcode and got accepted. Even though It's only been a month 
        since I've started this class I forsure think this is going to lead me into better things and even get me my dream job as a programmer. So Whoever is reading this, If you made
        it to this point, I'm going to leave you with one of my favorite quotes by Bill Gates "If you're born poor,It's not your fault.But if you die poor, it's your fault" so keep grinding.
